'''Task

You are given a two lists
and . Your task is to compute their cartesian product X

.

Example

A = [1, 2]
B = [3, 4]

AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

Note:
and

are sorted lists, and the cartesian product's tuples should be output in sorted order.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of list
.
The second line contains the space separated elements of list

.

Both lists have no duplicate integer elements.

Constraints


Output Format

Output the space separated tuples of the cartesian product.

Sample Input

 1 2
 3 4

Sample Output

 (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)
'''

from itertools import product

A = input().split()
A = list(map(int, A))
B = input().split()
B = list(map(int, B))

for i in product(A, B):
    print (i, end=" ")
